title: About Me
---

I love making the web better for everyone! Located in Madison, WI, I'm a front-end developer and designer with over 15 years experience of leading teams and creating for the web. I build accessible, responsive, and performant products for users, with intuitive architecture for easier maintenance and faster iteration time to market for creators.

I research user behavior and collaborate with stakeholders across disciplines to identify pain points and outline solutions to get you on the right path. This allows me to approach your product holistically with a long term vision to establish extensible systems, patterns, and processes to improve the overall experience and enable it to grow with you and your users' needs.
