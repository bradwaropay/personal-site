Hey there! Thanks for checking out my personal site.

As many developers know, keeping up a maintained personal site and portfolio can be a daunting task, but let's give it a go.

My goal is to keep this site simple and utilize it as a jumping off point for projects and experiments, as well as writing up my thoughts, learnings, and answer questions that usually only happen in one off discussions or end up on slack to peers. I hope that not only will this help me learn and grow, but also help others out along the way.

Stay tuned for future [articles](/articles) and [projects](/projects). Want to learn more about what I do and my background, check out my [about](/about) page.

That's it. Let's go make something awesome!
