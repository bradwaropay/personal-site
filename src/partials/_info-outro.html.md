When I'm not busy coding or experimenting with animation and interaction, I spend my time playing with new tech and gadgets, brewing up new batches of [beer](#), and slowly chipping away at the enormous backlog of books.

Currently, I work as a Senior Front End Developer at [meltmedia](http://www.meltmedia.com) in [always sunny](http://why.az) Tempe, Arizona.
