When I'm not busy coding or experimenting with interactions and design systems, I spend my time playing with new gadgets, brewing up new batches of [beer](#), and slowly chipping away at my gigantic backlog of books and articles.

Currently, I work as a Senior Front End Developer at [meltmedia](http://www.meltmedia.com) in [always sunny](http://why.az) Tempe, Arizona.
