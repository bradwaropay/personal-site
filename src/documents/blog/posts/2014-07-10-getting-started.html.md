As many developers, designers, and creative professionals who have a penchant perfectionism know, creating and maintaining a relevant personal site and portfolio with meaningful content is easier said than done. We can usually be our own worst clients. We're overly critical of our design choices and are never satisfied with the result or turn the task into a grand coding or design experiment, wanting to try something new or just to see if we can create it. Combine this with finding time among a work, other projects, and life in general, let alone the addition of curating portfolio pieces and content, it is one of those things that, even though we have good intentions, our ambitions get the better of us and always manages to fall to the wayside. 

These pitfalls have consistently left me scrambling to throw a portfolio or site placeholder together at the last minute when I really needed it. Leaving me completely disatisfied with the hasty and unpolished result. This is my attempt to remedy that situation.
